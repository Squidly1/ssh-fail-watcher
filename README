NOTE: This code does NOT currently work to create: http://vps2.pronto185.com/newfail
...but it will at some point... ^.^

...also, a log file that shows changes in new attempts/ports open close,etc..
    maybe format like:
        NEW IP: <ip> <rdns> <good/bad rdns?> <open ports>
        ATTEMPTS NEW <ip> New:<#of of new> Total:<total>
        PORTS CLOSED:<ip> <list of ports that were open last check, now closed>
        PORTS OPENED:<ip> <list of ports that were closed lask check, now open>
        RDNS CHANGE: <rdns changed?>
        
   do itas a funciont, something like def log(type, ip, rdns/data stuff?S).

currently only idea/thought process


a) central config file, config.ini
b) dirs for things
    eg:
    flask/, logs/, and scanner/
    have it more or less be what it is now

c) collect-data.py:
    run every <x time> (i do every hour)
    this script:
        if sees config[datafile_prev]:
           loads it for comparisoin
            sets compare to 1
        parses auth.log
            ip=new
                make new dict:
                    {'IP': '118.220.173.248', 'attempts': 1, 'geo': 'Korea, Republic of', 'IPCHECK': None, 'RDNS': None, 'age':1}
                    if scan = on
                        do port scan, save in another dict that gets dumps seprately
                        get ports to scan from config.ini
                        maybe use python-namp? why re-invent the wheel
                        if nmap, have config.ini option for what nmap flags?

          ip=old 
                'attempts'+=1

          
          ip
dump the dict
