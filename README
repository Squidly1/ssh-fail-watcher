currently only idea/thought process
a) central config file, config.ini
b) dirs for things
    eg:
    flask/, logs/, and scanner/
    have it more or less be what it is now

c) collect-data.py:
    run every <x time> (i do every hour)
    this script:
        if sees config[datafile_prev]:
           loads it for comparisoin
            sets compare to 1
        parses auth.log
            ip=new
                make new dict:
                    {'IP': '118.220.173.248', 'attempts': 1, 'geo': 'Korea, Republic of', 'IPCHECK': None, 'RDNS': None, 'age':1}
                    if scan = on
                        do port scan, save in another dict that gets dumps seprately
                        get ports to scan from config.ini
                        maybe use python-namp? why re-invent the wheel
                        if nmap, have config.ini option for what nmap flags?

          ip=old 
                'attempts'+=1

          
          ip
dump the dict
